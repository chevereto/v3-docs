# Container Registry

Use [chevereto/container-builder](https://github.com/chevereto/container-builder) to create your own private Chevereto container images which will be available in the container registry of your choice.

The system works by using a GitHub template repository which you clone in your account. You configure your own build context and generate on demand, for free, your own private Chevereto container images.

## Setup

The [SETUP](https://github.com/chevereto/container-builder/blob/3.20/docs/SETUP.md) guide explains how to use the template for your own project.

## Building

The [BUILDING](https://github.com/chevereto/container-builder/blob/3.20/docs/BUILDING.md) guide follows the process to generate your container images on demand.

## Updating

The [UPDATING](https://github.com/chevereto/container-builder/blob/3.20/docs/UPDATING.md) guide outlines the process required to update your repository changes with the new updates published in the base template.
